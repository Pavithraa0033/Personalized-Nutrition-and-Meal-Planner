### Project Description
The Personalized Nutrition and Meal Planner is a web application designed to create customized meal plans based on an individual's age, weight, height, health goals, and dietary preferences. The application provides a tailored meal plan along with BMI calculations to help users achieve their fitness objectives.

### The Problem statement
People often struggle to find reliable and personalized dietary plans to meet their fitness goals. Generic plans don‚Äôt consider individual needs like BMI, health goals, or dietary restrictions, making them ineffective.

### The Solution
We simplify healthy eating by generating meal plans tailored to individual health goals and preferences using BMI calculations. It's like having your personal nutritionist, but for free!
